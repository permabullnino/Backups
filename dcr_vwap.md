Decred On-Chain: The Ticket Pool VWAP

Introduction / Roadmap

In my previous piece "DCR On-Chain: A Look at Block Subsidies", we explored the ultimate Network-Based indicator - block rewards, and their relationship to network valuation from the point of view of the network itself, miners, stakers, and the DCR treasury. Within this article we will begin to explore and uncover the magic behind the ultimate Decred User-Based indicator - ticket data, and show how it provides a means for effectively gauging the HODL behavior of users within the Decred Network. This article aims to be a foundational piece in understanding ticket data for future pieces, explain why it's worthwhile analyzing, and hopefully provide some color for Decred-curious on-chain analysts within the cryptocurrency space. Below are the topics that will be covered within:

(1) Decred Tickets: What they are, functions they serve, and ticket parameters
(2) Analysis of User-Based Indicators in Crypto-Networks
(3) How Decred Tickets Break the Mold for User-Based Indicators
(4) Definitions of "HODLing" in Different Crypto-Networks
(5) Introducing the Ticket Pool VWAP
(6) Analysis of 14, 28, and 140 Day DCRUSD Ticket Pool VWAP
(7) Analysis of 14, 28, and 140 Day DCRBTC Ticket Pool VWAP
(8) Lifetime DCRUSD VWAP, Lifetime DCRBTC VWAP, and Cumulative Cap
(9) Closing Thoughts

Decred Tickets: What They Are, Functions They Serve and Ticket Parameters

Tickets are the semi-scarce asset of Decred's Proof of Stake mechanism. The scarcity of tickets, along with what tickets provide access to within the network, make them a highly sought after resource among all Decred advocates. Just like Proof of Work, which is semi-scarce as a function of (1) difficulty retargeting based on demand for hash and (2) profitability in acquiring additional units of hash - tickets are semi-scarce as a function of (1) ticket price regularly retargeting based on demand for tickets and (2) the scarcity of available DCR on the market to purchase tickets. This combination of scarcity, incentive to compete for the scarce object, and making the pricing of the scarce object determined by purely market driven forces are what Decred's Proof of Stake / Ticketing mechanism a reliable second authentication layer as it relates to enforcing digital scarcity, and ultimately a grand innovation in applying the principles which make Proof of Work special in a stake-based scheme.
